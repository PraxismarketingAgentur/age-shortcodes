Add shortcodes for the age of someone or something in years

== Description ==

**Age Shortcodes** lets you insert the current age in years of someone or something anywhere in your WordPress site with a simple shortcode.

Use the shortcode **`[age birthday="yyyy-mm-dd"]`** in any post, page or widget to display the current age in years.

## How it works

The `[age birthday="1973-10-15"]` year old American musician Dax Riggs is best known for fronting the band Acid Bath.

The Golden Gate Bridge was opened `[age birthday="1937-05-27"]` years ago.
