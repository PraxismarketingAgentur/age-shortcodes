Add shortcodes for the age of someone or something in years

== Description ==

**Age Shortcodes** lets you insert the current age in years of someone or something anywhere in your WordPress site with a simple shortcode.

Use the shortcode **[age birthday="dd-mm-yyyy"]** in any post, page or widget to display the current age in years.

## How it works

**[age birthday="20-04-1969"]** - inserts the current age in years e.g. **54**
**[age birthday="1969-04-20"]** - inserts the current age in years e.g. **54**
**[age birthday="20.04.1969"]** - inserts the current age in years e.g. **54**
**[age birthday="20. April 1969"]** - inserts the current age in years e.g. **54**
